# LatiPhonics

The main goal of the project is to help users learn specific sounds of the English language by using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as a reference. With the help of Artificial Intelligence, the project generates everyday phrases based on the user's personal 'About Me' information.

- [Project Board](https://github.com/users/frankcampos/projects/10)

The user is someone who wants to learn how to speak English. In my case, English is my second language, and while we share the same alphabet, the sounds of the vowels and consonants can be very different. Practicing these sounds helps improve both pronunciation and listening skills.

1. You can add, delete, and update sounds on the Sounds page.
1. You can add sounds to a personal list.
1. You can remove and view sounds in your personal list.
1. On the view page, you have the option to add a video.

1. You can add notes on the view sound page.
1. On your profile page, you can view and modify your profile information.
